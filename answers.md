I played 4 games and won 1
1) 5 of spades and 6 of clubs, 5 of clubs and 6 of clubs
2) Yes they have to be, because the deck adds up perfectly so that the only way to have 3 left would be a J, Q, and K
3) There is no strategy, it is based entirely off of luck. The cards you play do not affect which cards come up next, so there is no way to play it better.
